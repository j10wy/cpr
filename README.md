## Next.js

### Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).


First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

### Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Supabase

### Local Development Notes

#### Benefits of Local Development

1. **Faster Development**  
   - Instant results from changes without waiting for remote deployments.

2. **Offline Work**  
   - Continue working without an internet connection.

3. **Cost-Effective**  
   - Local development is free and doesn't impact your project's quota.

4. **Enhanced Privacy**  
   - Sensitive data stays on your local machine during development.

5. **Easy Testing**  
   - Experiment with configurations and features without risking your production environment.

#### Requirements for Local Development

1. **Supabase CLI**  
   - Used to start and manage the local Supabase stack.

2. **Docker**  
   - Runs the necessary services for Supabase.

#### Setting Up Local Development

1. **Install Supabase CLI and Docker Desktop**  
   - Ensure both tools are installed on your machine.

2. **Initialize a New Supabase Project**  
   - Use the CLI to create a project locally.

3. **Start the Local Stack**  
   - Launch all necessary Supabase services locally.

4. **Available Local Services**  
   - **PostgreSQL Database**
   - **Auth**
   - **Storage**
   - Other core Supabase features.

#### Local Development with Schema Migrations

- Flexible Development Options:
  - Use the Supabase Dashboard directly for quick setup.
  - Alternatively, use a proper local setup with the Supabase CLI.

- Recommended Workflow:
  - Develop locally using the CLI to run a local Supabase stack.
  - Use the integrated Supabase Studio Dashboard to make changes.
  - Capture changes in schema migration files.
  - Save migration files in version control (e.g., Git) for tracking and collaboration.

- Alternative Approach:
  - If comfortable with migration files and SQL:
  - Write migration files manually.
  - Push them to the local database for testing before sharing changes.

- Deploying Changes:
  - After developing and testing locally, deploy changes to a linked project on the Supabase Platform.
  - Version Control:
  - Keep all migration files and changes under version control to maintain history and enable collaboration.

### Supabase CLI

The Supabase CLI is a powerful tool for managing Supabase projects directly from the terminal. Key features include:

- Setting up and managing local development environments: Quickly create and control a self-contained local Supabase stack.
- Generating TypeScript types for your database schema: Helps ensure type safety in your code.
- Handling database migrations: Manage schema changes efficiently.
- Managing environment variables and secrets: Centralize and simplify sensitive configuration management.
- Deploying your project to the Supabase platform: Push changes to production with ease.

With the CLI, you can streamline your development workflow, automate repetitive tasks, and maintain consistency across different environments. Itâ€™s essential for local development and useful in CI/CD pipelines.

For further details, refer to the CLI Getting Started Guide.

#### Supabase Commands

1. Install the Supabase CLI
`brew install supabase/tap/supabase`

2. Initialize the Supabase Project
`supabase init`

3. Start the Supabase Stack
`supabase start`

4. Stop the Supabase Stack
`supabase stop`
